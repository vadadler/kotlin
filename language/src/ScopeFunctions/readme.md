The Kotlin standard library contains several functions whose sole purpose is to execute a block of code within the context 
of an object. When you call such a function on an object with a lambda expression provided, it forms a temporary scope. 
In this scope, you can access the object without its name. Such functions are called scope functions.

Scope functions make code more <b>clear</b>, <b>readable</b>, and <b>concise</b> which are Kotlin languageâ€™s main features.
